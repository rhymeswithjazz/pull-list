{"id":"pull-list-7rf","title":"fix one off bug","description":"Our last PR was to fix an issue where tracked series books were incorrectly showing One-Off badges.\n\nRoot cause: The is_one_off column existed in production but had incorrect values (likely all True). The initial migration only populated values when first creating the column.\n\nFix: Updated migration to check if any books have is_one_off = True, and if so, sets ALL books to is_one_off = False (since no one-offs are currently configured). Only runs once.\n\nPRs:\n- #15 (merged) - initial fix attempt\n- #17 (open) - simplified fix","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-29T20:37:41.368451-05:00","created_by":"ras","updated_at":"2025-12-29T21:07:14.937081-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-29T21:07:14.937081-05:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
